# api.ai + Rekognition

[api.ai] is an API which offers voice recognition, natural language processing and text-to-speech. It allows users to integrate speech interfaces into their products.

[ReKognition] is an API which offers facial, object and scene recognition.

Through the combination of both API's, this project aims to create a [Mathematica] (and eventually, [Wolfram Cloud]) - based interactive interface, through which a user can recognise/detect faces in a photo using a variety of voice commands. 

[Here's] a blog post about this project.
